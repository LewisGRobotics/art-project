# art-project

WORK IN PROGRESS: I'm using this project to practice Typescript, angular directives and pipes, and do something that I can style with SCSS to look good.
 
This Angular 11 application allows you to make a somewhat artistic image. The idea is to allow the user to create a matrix of solid color geometrical items, let him choose how to arrange them, shapes, color, to create something that looks like (but ain't) modern art. I'll add some color palettes to facilitate that the result looks good no matter what you do, and try to make a very pretty user interface.

Maybe I could even add a Firebase or database REST API connection so that you can save your work in a server and you get back a special unique code, so that you can input it later to get your precious piece of art when you open the app again. That could also be fun.
